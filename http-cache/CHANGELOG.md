## [0.21.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added

- MSRV is now 1.82.0

## [0.20.1] - 2025-01-30

### Changed

- Fixed missing implementation of CacheMode::Reload variant logic.

- Updated the minimum versions of the following dependencies:
  - async-trait [0.1.85]
  - cacache [13.1.0]
  - httpdate [1.0.2]
  - moka [0.12.10]
  - serde [1.0.217]
  - url [2.5.4]

## [0.20.0] - 2024-11-12

### Added

- `cache_status_headers` field to `HttpCacheOptions` struct. This field is a boolean that determines if the cache status headers should be added to the response.

## [0.19.0] - 2024-04-10

### Changed

- Updated the minimum versions of the following dependencies:
  - cacache [13.0.0]
  - http [1.1.0]
  - http-cache-semantics [2.1.0]

## [0.18.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added

- `overridden_cache_mode` method to `Middleware` trait. This method allows for overriding any cache mode set in the configuration, including `cache_mode_fn`.

- Derive `Default` for the `CacheMode` enum with the mode `Default` selected to be used.

## [0.17.0] - 2023-11-01

### Added

- `cache_mode_fn` field to `HttpCacheOptions` struct. This is a closure that takes a `&http::request::Parts` and returns a `CacheMode` enum variant. This allows for the overriding of cache mode on a per-request basis.

- `cache_bust` field to `HttpCacheOptions` struct. This is a closure that takes `http::request::Parts`, `Option<CacheKey>`, the default cache key (`&str`) and returns `Vec<String>` of keys to bust the cache for.

### Changed

- Updated the minimum versions of the following dependencies:
  - cacache [12.0.0]

## [0.16.0] - 2023-09-28

### Added

- `can_cache_request` method to `HttpCache` struct. This can be used by client implementations to determine if the request should be cached.

- `run_no_cache` method to `HttpCache` struct. This should be run by client implementations if the request is determined to not be cached.

### Changed

- MSRV is now 1.67.1

## [0.15.0] - 2023-09-26

### Added

- `IgnoreRules` variant to the `CacheMode` enum. This mode will ignore the HTTP headers and always store a response given it was a 200 response. It will also ignore the staleness when retrieving a response from the cache, so expiration of the cached response will need to be handled manually. If there was no cached response it will create a normal request, and will update the cache with the response.

### Changed

- Updated the minimum versions of the following dependencies:
  - moka [0.12.0]

## [0.14.0] - 2023-07-28

### Added

- `cacache-async-std` feature, which enables `async_std` runtime support in the `cacache` backend manager. This feature is enabled by default.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-07-19

### Added

### Changed

- `CacheManager` trait `get`, `put`, and `delete` methods now require a `cache_key` argument rather than `method` and `url` arguments. This allows for custom keys to be specified.
